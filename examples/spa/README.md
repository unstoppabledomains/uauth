This is a simple `create-react-app` demo of a `uauth` integration. If you've never heard of create react app you can learn more [here](https://create-react-app.dev).

The entire demo project is contained and anotated inside the `src/index.ts` file.

## Installation

This project uses the local versions of the `uauth` packages. If you want to test a particular version of the `uauth` packages you should checkout a version tag of this repo.

Once checked out simply install the dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

And your good to go!

## Running

Simply run `yarn start` like any other `create-react-app` project.
